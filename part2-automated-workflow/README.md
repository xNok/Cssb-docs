# Introdution

An automated workflow helps you to save many hour of your time by using pre-programmed commands lines. Moreover, Creating such tools is a bit like writing a recipes book, containing all the boring task you used to do. From now, we called this recipes book the __gulpfile__.

However creating such a work-flow required you to spend some time first to develop it. It's still bit difficult to get a complete and an reliable engine, because  you have to together a lot of technology and make them work together in the proper way.

The purpose of this documentation is to let you discover few technologies that I picked and integrated to my work-flow
Every time I will also quotes alternative choices to each of those technology to gives the maximum information to make your choices. So with the documentation you can understand my project and maybe start to build your own work-flow.

So in this documentation will explore the following point

* Construct a workflow step by step  with gulp
    * define the tasks that you want to be automated
    * testing your tasks, and ensure the reliability of your workflow
* Explore the possibilities of npm for creating a workflow
    * define task with npm
    * extends gulp by creating your own plugin

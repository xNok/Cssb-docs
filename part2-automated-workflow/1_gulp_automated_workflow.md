# Create a Gulp Automated work-flow

## Get Ready

Before you can start with your automated work-flow you need to install some softwares.

Start by install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node.js is a javaScript server, that's simply means it is a server reading/executing javaScript language. 

Node.js comes with a very interesting tool witch is __npm__ a package manager. You will use npm to install, share, distribute code and manage dependencies. Npm it is also an [online platform](https://www.npmjs.com/) where you can find more than 250 000 package to create your work-flow.

Lets install your first package with __npm__. You may have already find the name of this package.

> npm init
> npm install gulp --save-dev

The flag `--save-dev` will register _gulp_ as a `devDependencies` into your [package.json]() file, the file in charged of collecting all the information about your project. For the dependencies essential for the production mode of your project use the flag `--save`.

The npm different dependences levels are

| Nom | Usage | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
|dependences         | production  | . |
|devdependencies     | development | . |
|peerdependences     |             | . |
|optianaldependencies|             | . |
|bundledependencies  |             | . |

Note that you can also install gulp globally.

> npm install -g gulp

## Gulpfile

### Define a tasks

Now that you have install gulp and all the dependencies, you can start your gulp file with the first task.

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('task:name', function() {
   //do something 
});
```

This task is very useless but you can test it :
> gulp task:name

Now that your task is working we can make something useful such as compiling you sass files into css.

first add __gulp-sass__ :
> npm i gulp-sass -D

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');            //the sass module

gulp.task('task:name', function() {
  gulp.src(pathIN)                          //select our files
  .pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))  //go thought the sass function
  .pipe(gulp.dest(pathOUT))                 //go out
});
```

A task is always construct as following :
    1. you get the files you need with `gulp.scr` - it is the sources
    2. you files go thought function with the function `pipe`
    3. the you write the computed files where you when with `gulp.src`

See this task like a flow of water, our files go thought pipes, are modified by the current en then or pushing out.

Now let's create an even more complicated task :
    1. compile sass
    2. add cross-browser tags

first add __autoprefixer__ :
> npm i autoprefixer -D

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');            //the sass module
var autoprefixer = require('autoprefixer'); //the autoprefixer module

gulp.task('task:name', function() {
  gulp.src(pathIN)                          //select our files
  .pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))  //go thought the sass function
  .pipe(autoprefixer(options.autoprefixer)) //go thought the sass function
  .pipe(gulp.dest(pathOUT))                 //go out
});
```

### Divide your gulpfile

'Divide and rule'. A good process could be to divide your gulpfile into smaller part. So you can share your woks and some part of your automated work-flow

#### First methode

The first thing to do is installing `require-dir` and reference it into your gulpfile. Then require the directories where are stored your task.

``` javascript
var requireDir = require('require-dir');
requireDir('./gulptasks', { recurse: true });
```

This is a very widespread method, but I disagree on that point because most off the tasks are 3~4 lines or a list of task with [runSequence](). That why I prefer import that way only the tasks that I called [helpers](). The other task can stay in your gulpfile as a cookBook with all the recipes and for each the list of the ingredient.

#### Second methode

This method keep the definition of your task in your gulpfile, but `require` a function that you stored in an other file. This is very useful to keep this idea or cookbook but also for running unit tests.

I have files containing the structure of the task for example :

```coffeescript
###
@plugin : test
@input  : pathIN, pathOUT, options
@options: test
###
exports.myFunction = (pathIN, pathOUT, options) ->
  return () -> 
      gulp.src pathIN
      .pipe test(options.test)
      .pipe gulp.dest(pathOUT)
```

Now, you can use it in your gulpfile as following :

``` coffeescript
frontdevCompile = require('./tasks__frontdev/compile.coffee')

###
@plugin : test
@input  : pathIN, pathOUT, options
@options: test
###
gulp.task 'compile:sass','Build the css assets', ->
  frontdevCompile.test pathIN, pathOUT, options

```

## testing your task
